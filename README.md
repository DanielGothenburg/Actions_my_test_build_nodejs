# Actions_my_test_build_nodejs
This is to test how to do a build with an action. In this example using nodejs.

The folder contains two workflows.

The successful one is called node.js

This has been built using following sections in Github documentation:
Using workflows/Starter Workflow and 
Test&Build/Test&Build Node.js

The starter workflows comes with npm. The npm install command contains process to check for package.json file, but also if you use command npm ci then it will try and generate a file called package-lock.json
package-lock.json is an autogenerated file by nmp ci and might fail. Hence do not use command npm ci as part of run. Only do command npm install
