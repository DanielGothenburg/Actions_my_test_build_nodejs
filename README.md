# Actions_my_test_build_nodejs
This is to test how to do a build with an action. In this example using nodejs.

Syntax in instruction seems incorrect, but not that works. However when doing a push and triggering the workflow it seems as it requires to have package.json available (see error message under Actions menu). so create such a file and find what contents is required.
